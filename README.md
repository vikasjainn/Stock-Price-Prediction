## Introduction.

Stock price prediction is a challenging problem, and this application utilizes LSTM, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN), to capture long-term dependencies in historical stock data. The app preprocesses the data, trains the LSTM model, and generates predictions for future stock prices.

## Features.

- **User-Friendly Interface:** The app provides an intuitive interface for users to enter stock symbols and select prediction timeframes easily.

- **Real-Time Data:** The application fetches real-time stock price data from reliable financial APIs, ensuring the most up-to-date predictions.

- **Predictive Analytics:** Utilizing LSTM and other machine learning techniques, the app offers accurate stock price predictions for the chosen timeframes.

- **Visualization:** The app displays visually appealing charts and graphs to illustrate historical and predicted stock price trends.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Flask
- Pandas
- NumPy
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Matplotlib

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/stock-prediction-app.git
   cd stock-prediction-app
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies using pip:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the Flask app:

   ```
   python app.py
   ```

2. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` to access the application.

## Model Training

To retrain the LSTM model or experiment with different parameters:

1. Modify the model architecture and hyperparameters in `model.py`.

2. Prepare your historical stock price data in a CSV format with columns: 'Date' and 'Close'.

3. Run the training script:

   ```
   python train_model.py --data your_data.csv
   ```
